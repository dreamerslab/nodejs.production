# node.js on production

Running a node app is easy, however to bring it onto the production level isn't. The followings are the tools and steps I use to run my node apps on an Ubuntu server on linode.



## Create user for node.js app

    # sudo adduser <username>
    $ sudo adduser nodejs --home /home/nodejs --shell /bin/bash
    # password: your_password
    # fullname: nodejs



## Increase the open file limit

    # only `nodejs` and nginx user can open more files
    $ sudo su
    $ echo "nodejs soft nofile 51200" >> /etc/security/limits.conf
    $ echo "nodejs hard nofile 51200" >> /etc/security/limits.conf
    $ echo "www-data hard nofile 51200" >> /etc/security/limits.conf
    $ echo "www-data hard nofile 51200" >> /etc/security/limits.conf
    $ echo "session required pam_limits.so" >> /etc/pam.d/common-session
    $ exit



## Run your node app as daemon with upstart

The problem with node is that you have to manually start your app with `node your_app.js` on terminal through ssh. However if you close the connection it shuts down. Therefore we have to run it as daemon which means it will automatically start at server start and gives you an easy way to stop or restart it through some simple commands. Here we can use a build-in tool from Ubuntu call `upstart`. You can modify the example file `upstart.conf` to fit your app.

### Steps

> Create the script

    $ cd /etc/init/
    $ sudo touch your_app_name.conf

> Edit the script

    $ sudo vi your_app_name.conf

> Copy from the example file and modify it to fit your need

### Commands

> Start your app

    $ start your_app_name

> Stop your app

    $ stop your_app_name

> Restart your app

    $ restart your_app_name



## Monitor your node app with Monit

node app crashes for any shitty reason like undefined variables. With `monit` you don't have to worry about that, it monitors your app and if it dies `monit` will restart it for you. Please see the example file `monitrc` to setup your own `monit` script. However don't forget you still have to log for errors and fix them.

### Installation on Ubuntu

    $ sudo apt-get install monit

### Edit configs

- edit /etc/default/monit and set the "startup" variable to 1
- edit /etc/monit/monitrc and use the example file monitrc

### Run

    $ sudo /etc/init.d/monit start
    $ sudo monit start your_app_name

## Nginx or not

The reason why we put a nginx server in front while we can use node to get all the request directly is that nginx runs faster with serving static files(css, js, img) and also it is more stable. We can easily use it as a reverse proxy to load balance across multiple node instances.

> Check out the example code - `nginx/nginx.conf` and `vhost.conf`



## Deploy your node app

Deploying a node app manually can be a pain in the ass. Therefore I wrote this simple bash script to do the job for me. Basically what it does is to pull your project from github, remove or switch config files from dev mode to production mode, stop services, remove lock file, adding tail to current app and switch it with the one that just pull down form github then restart the app.

> Check out the example code - `deploy.sh`

It took me a lot of time finding how to do all these, hope these samples help. If you find something wrong or you have better solutions, you are welcome to send pull requests :)
